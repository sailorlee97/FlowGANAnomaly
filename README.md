# FlowGANAnomaly
This project is an open-source project based on a GAN network anomaly detection â€˜zero dayâ€™ attack.

### Structure
`process_nslkdd.py`: Load the malicious traffic data set that needs to be trained

` model.py`: Model building and training process

` networks.py`:  Basic network structure, it is not recommended to change easily

`option.py`: Parameter file, this file supports four data sets: UNSW-NB15, CIC-IDS2017, NSL-KDD and CIC-DDoS2019

### How to use?

Choose a dataset for training, default NSL-KDD ,and then run ` python train.py`

if you want to change dataset, you need  change `--dataset` and ` --feature` parameters.
